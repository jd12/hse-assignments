# Choosing a Corpus
### Honors Software Engineering · 2026–27 · sources by interest, with the command that fetches each one

One text file, `data/corpus.txt`, carries you from A05b to the symposium. This is the menu. Pick something you will not mind reading five hundred search results from, because you will.

## What makes a corpus good (the checker enforces all of this)

| Property | Why | Number |
|---|---|---|
| Big | A search has something to find; a spring GPT produces readable text | ≥ 1,000,000 characters (warns below; fails under 200,000). 1–5 MB is the sweet spot |
| Plain UTF-8 text | The chunker and tokenizer read text, not PDF | `file data/corpus.txt` says UTF-8 or ASCII |
| Paragraphs separated by blank lines | A06 chunks on `\n\n` | ≥ 300 chunks of ≥ 200 characters |
| No license wrapper | Otherwise "Gutenberg" is a top hit all year | the `awk` rule in `fetch_corpus.sh` |
| Not mostly repeats | Navigation, running heads and OCR echoes poison search | < 10% duplicate lines |
| Legal, and shareable in excerpts | You paste results into committed files all year | public domain, CC BY / CC BY-SA, or your own |
| Re-fetchable | I re-run your numbers | `scripts/fetch_corpus.sh` reproduces the same sha256 |

**Size guide.** A novel is 400,000–1,200,000 characters. The Odyssey (Butler) is about 700,000, which is why the examples say "add the Iliad if you go Track B." The complete Shakespeare is 5.5 MB, which is plenty and slow. Two or three related books glued together is usually the right answer.

**Rule on private text.** Your own notes, chats and journals are allowed and are the most interesting corpora in the room. `data/` is git-ignored, but your search results, your model's outputs and your golden set are not: excerpts land in committed files, PR bodies and reflection answers. Scrub names, or pick something else.

**Non-English and non-prose corpora** (code, chess, another language) are allowed. The checker warns rather than fails; write in `SOURCE.md` what you expect to be different (tokenization, stopwords, what "a sentence" means).

## Project Gutenberg — literature, history, science, food (public domain)

The plain-text URL pattern is `https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/<ID>/pg<ID>.txt`. Find the ID by searching [gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org); it is the number in the book's URL. **Verify the ID by reading the first 40 lines of what you downloaded**, then let your own test in `tests/test_corpus.py` guard it forever.

Fetch and strip, the same way every time:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
mkdir -p data
ID=1727   # the Odyssey, Butler translation
curl -sSL "https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/$ID/pg$ID.txt" -o data/raw.txt
awk '/\*\*\* START OF/{flag=1; next} /\*\*\* END OF/{flag=0} flag' data/raw.txt > data/corpus.txt
rm data/raw.txt
```

To glue two books, fetch each to `data/raw1.txt`, `data/raw2.txt`, apply the `awk` to each, and `cat` them into `corpus.txt`. Older files carry a "Produced by …" credit *after* the START marker; if the checker flags it, add `sed '1,/^$/d'` to drop the first paragraph.

| Interest | Books (IDs to confirm on the site) | Rough size |
|---|---|---|
| **Epic / myth** | The Odyssey, Butler (1727) · The Iliad, Butler (6130) · Beowulf (16328) · Bulfinch's Mythology (4928) | 0.7 MB each; Odyssey + Iliad ≈ 1.6 MB |
| **Novels** | Moby Dick (2701, 1.2 MB) · War and Peace (2600, 3.2 MB) · Pride and Prejudice (1342, 0.7 MB) · Dracula (345, 0.9 MB) · Frankenstein (84, 0.4 MB) · The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1661, 0.6 MB) + The Memoirs (834) + The Return (108) | one novel is usually 0.5–1.2 MB |
| **Complete Shakespeare** | 100 | 5.5 MB; cut to the tragedies if it is slow |
| **History — ancient** | Herodotus, *The Histories* (2707 vol. 1, 2456 vol. 2) · Thucydides, *Peloponnesian War* (7142) · Plutarch's *Lives* (674) · Gibbon, *Decline and Fall* vol. 1 (25717) | 0.8–1.5 MB each |
| **History — American** | The Federalist Papers (1404, 1.2 MB) · Grant's *Personal Memoirs* (4367, 1.5 MB) · Frederick Douglass, *Narrative* (23) + *My Bondage and My Freedom* (202) · Lincoln's speeches and writings (search "Lincoln" — several volumes) | Federalist alone is enough |
| **Science** | Darwin, *On the Origin of Species* (1228, 0.9 MB) + *The Voyage of the Beagle* (944) · Newton's *Opticks* (search) · Faraday, *The Chemical History of a Candle* (14474) | Darwin pair ≈ 1.7 MB |
| **Philosophy** | Plato, *The Republic* (1497) · Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations* (2680) · Thoreau, *Walden* (205) | 0.4–1.2 MB |
| **Food** | Fannie Farmer, *The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book* (search) · Escoffier, *A Guide to Modern Cookery* (search) · any pre-1929 cookbook | recipes chunk beautifully; headings repeat, which is fine |
| **Sports (old)** | Christy Mathewson, *Pitching in a Pinch* (search) · Spalding's baseball guides · A. G. Spalding, *America's National Game* (search) | 0.3–0.8 MB; pair two |

## Wikipedia — sports, games, film, music, current technology (CC BY-SA 4.0; credit it in SOURCE.md)

Any set of related articles. Plain text comes from the API's `extracts` endpoint, one article per request. Put the titles in a file, one per line, and this script assembles the corpus with a blank line between paragraphs and the title as a heading:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/fetch_corpus.sh — Wikipedia articles listed in data/titles.txt
set -e
mkdir -p data
: > data/corpus.txt
while IFS= read -r title; do
  [ -z "$title" ] && continue
  encoded=$(python3 -c "import urllib.parse,sys; print(urllib.parse.quote(sys.argv[1]))" "$title")
  curl -sSL "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&explaintext=1&format=json&redirects=1&titles=$encoded" \
    -H "User-Agent: hse-corpus/1.0 (student project)" \
    | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin)['query']['pages']; print(next(iter(d.values())).get('extract',''))" >> data/corpus.txt
  printf "\n\n" >> data/corpus.txt
  sleep 0.5
done < data/titles.txt
wc -c data/corpus.txt
```

Commit `data/titles.txt` (add `!data/titles.txt` to `.gitignore`). Section headings come out as `== Heading ==`; leave them, they are useful anchors for the golden set.

| Interest | `data/titles.txt` | Rough size |
|---|---|---|
| **NFL** | `Super Bowl I` … `Super Bowl LX` (60 lines) | ≈ 1.5–2 MB |
| **NBA** | `1980 NBA Finals` … `2026 NBA Finals`, plus `Michael Jordan`, `LeBron James`, `Stephen Curry` | ≈ 1.5 MB |
| **Soccer** | `1930 FIFA World Cup` … `2026 FIFA World Cup` (23 lines) + `UEFA Champions League` finals | ≈ 1.5 MB |
| **Baseball** | `1903 World Series` … `2025 World Series` | ≈ 2 MB |
| **Olympics** | every Summer Olympics article, 1896–2024 | ≈ 2 MB |
| **Formula 1** | every `<year> Formula One World Championship` since 1950 | ≈ 3 MB |
| **Video games** | every mainline entry of one franchise + its developers; or every game in a genre's "List of …" article, one per line | 1–3 MB |
| **Film** | a director's filmography (one article per film) | ≈ 1 MB per 25 films |
| **Music** | an artist's albums, one article each, plus the artist | 0.5–1.5 MB |
| **Space** | every Apollo mission + every Space Shuttle mission | ≈ 2 MB |
| **Technology history** | `History of the Internet`, `ARPANET`, `Unix`, `Linux`, `Python (programming language)`, `JavaScript`, `TCP/IP`, `World Wide Web`, `Git`, `Transformer (deep learning architecture)` … pick 40 | ≈ 1.5 MB |

The simplest way to make a titles list: open the category or "List of …" page, copy the link text, one per line.

## Technology — documentation and standards (open licenses)

These are prose about code, which is a good corpus and an honest one: keyword search beats semantic search on exact identifiers, and you get to see that.

**RFCs (public domain-ish; IETF Trust license permits this use).** HTTP, TLS and the classic Internet protocols, as plain text with paragraph structure already in place:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
mkdir -p data; : > data/corpus.txt
for n in 791 793 1034 1035 2616 5321 6455 7540 8446 9110 9111 9112 9113 9114; do
  curl -sSL "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc$n.txt" >> data/corpus.txt
  printf "\n\n" >> data/corpus.txt
done
# drop the page-break running heads that repeat on every page
sed -i.bak -E '/^RFC [0-9]+ .* [A-Z][a-z]+ [0-9]{4}$/d; /^[A-Za-z].*\[Page [0-9]+\]$/d' data/corpus.txt && rm data/corpus.txt.bak
wc -c data/corpus.txt
```

The `sed` line matters: without it the checker's duplicate-line test fails on the page headers. About 2.5 MB.

**Node.js API docs (MIT).** One Markdown file per module; the rest of this course's agent is written in TypeScript, so this is a corpus you will actually query for real:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nodejs/node.git /tmp/node
cat /tmp/node/doc/api/*.md > data/corpus.txt
rm -rf /tmp/node
```

About 4 MB. Markdown headings and code fences survive; that is fine.

**The Rust Book (MIT/Apache).** `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/rust-lang/book.git /tmp/book && cat /tmp/book/src/*.md > data/corpus.txt`. About 1.5 MB of unusually well-written prose.

**Python docs (PSF license).** `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/python/cpython.git /tmp/cpython && cat /tmp/cpython/Doc/library/*.rst > data/corpus.txt`. About 10 MB; take `Doc/tutorial/*.rst` plus twenty modules you use instead.

**Git's own docs (GPL-2).** `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/git/git.git /tmp/git && cat /tmp/git/Documentation/git-*.txt > data/corpus.txt`. Every man page you have ever half-read, about 2 MB.

**Your own code.** Docstrings and READMEs from repositories you wrote. Allowed if they are yours, and the most personal corpus available; usually too small on its own.

## Science — arXiv abstracts (arXiv license permits abstract redistribution with attribution)

Two thousand abstracts from one category, one paragraph each, is a corpus with a very different shape from a novel: short chunks, dense vocabulary, lots of near-duplicates. Good for retrieval, poor for the spring GPT unless you take more.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
mkdir -p data
curl -sSL "http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=cat:cs.LG&start=0&max_results=2000&sortBy=submittedDate" -o data/raw.xml
python3 - <<'EOF'
import re, html
x = open("data/raw.xml", encoding="utf-8").read()
titles = re.findall(r"<title>(.*?)</title>", x, re.S)[1:]        # first <title> is the feed's
abstracts = re.findall(r"<summary>(.*?)</summary>", x, re.S)
with open("data/corpus.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for t, a in zip(titles, abstracts):
        f.write(html.unescape(t.strip()) + "\n\n" + " ".join(html.unescape(a).split()) + "\n\n")
EOF
rm data/raw.xml
wc -c data/corpus.txt
```

Swap `cs.LG` for `astro-ph`, `q-bio`, `physics.pop-ph`, `math.HO`. The API asks for a 3-second pause between requests; one request of 2,000 is fine. About 2 MB.

## Games — chess (CC0)

The Lichess open database is CC0. A month of games is gigabytes, so take the first N games of one month. PGN is text: moves, results, and a header per game. A character-level model trained on it learns to write legal-looking chess, which is a memorable spring milestone.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
mkdir -p data
# a rated-standard month; pick one from https://database.lichess.org/ and paste its URL
URL="https://database.lichess.org/standard/lichess_db_standard_rated_2013-01.pgn.zst"
curl -sSL "$URL" | zstd -d | head -c 3000000 > data/corpus.txt   # brew install zstd
# PGN games are separated by blank lines already; strip the per-game headers if you only want moves:
# sed -i.bak '/^\[/d' data/corpus.txt
wc -c data/corpus.txt
```

The checker will warn "not English prose" and "high type-token ratio." Both are correct and both are fine; say so in `SOURCE.md`.

---

## Law and government (public domain)

**Supreme Court opinions** via CourtListener's API, or the plain-text opinions at `https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/opinions/` (free key). Simpler: Gutenberg carries the Constitution (5), the Declaration (1), and Lincoln; Wikisource carries every State of the Union address (`https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Portal:State_of_the_Union_Speeches_by_United_States_Presidents`, fetch each page's `?action=raw` URL the same way as the Wikipedia script). The full set of State of the Union addresses is about 4 MB and chunks cleanly by paragraph.

---

## What not to pick

Song lyrics, subtitles, news sites, anything behind a login, anything from a Discord or group chat that is not only yours, textbooks still in copyright, and PDFs. Not because the checker will catch all of them (it will not) but because you will be pasting excerpts into a public-facing repository for eight months, and I will not merge a PR whose evidence file quotes something you had no right to copy.

## Writing `data/SOURCE.md`

```markdown
# Corpus
Title: Super Bowl articles I–LX
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/ (titles in data/titles.txt)
License: CC BY-SA 4.0, Wikipedia contributors
Fetched: 2026-09-28 by scripts/fetch_corpus.sh
sha256: <the full hash from shasum -a 256 data/corpus.txt>

What I expect to be different: team names and player names repeat across articles, so
keyword search will do well on names and badly on "who won in a blowout"; the == Heading ==
lines will show up as short chunks and I drop them at 200 chars.
```

The checker reads `SOURCE.md` and fails if the URL, the word "license," or a matching sha256 is missing.
